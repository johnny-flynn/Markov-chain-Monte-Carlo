To run this program, navigate to the directory where it is located, and run
the command:

    python3 bayes.py

This will give you the outputs for each of the 5 runs.

If you have PyCharm installed (or have a way to get matplotlib working thorugh
your command line), then you can go through the program and uncomment the
following lines:

    Line 2: import matplotlib
    Lines 60-108: showGraph function
    Line 149: call showGraph function

Doing so and running the program will execute the same way, except it will
show a nice line plot of the 5 runs and their values in graph form. This is
a great way to see how the values converge as the iterations get higher.
